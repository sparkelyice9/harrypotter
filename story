harry potter had finally got his letter from hogwarts, where he was destined to go to school just like his parents once did. On his way there, he made two friends, one was a red-headed boy named ron weasley and the other was a smart and elegant girl whos name was Hermione. 
when they arrived at hogwarts, they met a huge giant or so they thought, he was actually half giant and half human, his name was Hagrid.
He took them to a huge hall, where they could see all the other students seated for dinner and ready to watch the freshmans get sorted into their houses.
